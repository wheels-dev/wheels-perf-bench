    tests/populate.cfm — bootstraps the test database before specs run.

    `wheels test` runs against the `<appname>_test` datasource (a
    separate SQLite file from your dev DB) so chapter-6-style manual
    signups in development don't bleed into chapter-7 specs. The first
    time the test DB is empty (no migrator-versions table), the
    framework includes this file from app-runner.cfm to apply your
    migrations.

    Customise this file when you need test-specific seed data — model
    fixtures, baseline users, anything that should exist before EVERY
    test run. Keep it minimal; most specs should set up their own state
    via beforeEach/it blocks rather than relying on global fixtures.

    The framework only includes this file when:
    - the request was made with ?useTestDB=true (set automatically by
      `wheels test`; opt out with --no-test-db)
    - a `<dataSourceName>_test` datasource is registered (created
      automatically by `wheels new` when you accept the SQLite default)
    - the test DB has no migrator-versions table

    On second and subsequent runs the test DB schema persists, so this
    file is skipped. Delete `db/test.sqlite` to force a fresh schema.

<cfscript>
    // Run all pending migrations against the active datasource —
    // app-runner.cfm has already swapped application.wheels.dataSourceName
    // to the <appname>_test datasource before this file is included.
    if (StructKeyExists(application.wheels, "migrator")) {
        application.wheels.migrator.migrateToLatest();
    }

    // Add test-specific seed data below if you need it. For example:
    //
    //     application.wo.model("User").create(
    //         email = "fixture@example.com",
    //         password = "test1234"
    //     );
</cfscript>
