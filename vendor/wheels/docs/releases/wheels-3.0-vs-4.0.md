# Wheels 3.0 → 4.0 — Ground Made Up

A category-by-category comparison showing how Wheels 4.0 closed framework-maturity gaps that existed in 3.0. Only **capabilities that changed** between the 3.0.0 stable release (2026-01-10) and 4.0 are shown here; rows that were already present and unchanged are omitted for clarity.

**Companion docs:**
- [docs/wheels-vs-frameworks.md](../wheels-vs-frameworks.md) — Wheels 4.0 parity comparison against Rails 8, Laravel 12, Django 5.
- [docs/releases/wheels-4.0-audit.md](wheels-4.0-audit.md) — full 260+ PR audit of everything shipped between 3.0.0 and 4.0.

**Sources:** CHANGELOG.md `[3.0.0]` section (what 3.0 shipped) + 4.0 feature audit (what 4.0 adds). "Formalized" means the feature may have had partial/undocumented precedent but became production-ready with tests and official docs in 4.0.

## Peer-framework context — where 4.0 closed gaps

These are the rows where 3.0 trailed peer frameworks and 4.0 closed the gap. Reference the [parity comparison](../wheels-vs-frameworks.md) for full context.

| Capability | Rails 8 | Laravel 12 | Django 5 | Wheels 3.0 | Wheels 4.0 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Bulk insert/upsert | Yes (`insert_all` / `upsert_all`) | Yes (`upsert`) | Yes (`bulk_create`) | **No** | **Yes** |
| Polymorphic associations | Yes | Yes (`morphTo`) | Via contrib | **No** | **Yes** |
| Advisory locks | Via gem | No native | No native | **No** | **Yes** |
| Pessimistic locking | Yes (`.lock`) | Yes (`lockForUpdate`) | Yes (`select_for_update`) | **No** | **Yes** |
| Route model binding | Yes | Yes | No | **No** | **Yes** |
| First-class middleware pipeline | Yes (Rack) | Yes | Yes | **No** | **Yes** |
| Rate limiting | Yes (`Rack::Attack`-style via gem) | Yes (`RateLimiter`) | Via package | **No** | **Yes (built-in)** |
| Security headers (CSP/HSTS/Permissions) | Via gem / defaults | Via config | Via middleware | **No** | **Yes (built-in)** |
| Browser testing | Yes (Capybara) | Yes (Dusk) | Yes (Selenium) | **No** | **Yes (Playwright Java)** |
| Parallel test runner | Yes | Yes | Via package | **No** | **Yes** |
| HTTP integration test client | Yes | Yes | Yes | **No** | **Yes** |
| Request-scoped DI | Yes (via Rack middleware) | Yes (container scopes) | N/A (function-based) | **No** | **Yes** |
| Auto-migrations from models | No (manual) | No (manual) | Yes (`makemigrations`) | **No** | **Yes** |
| SSE pub/sub channels | Via gem (ActionCable is WebSocket) | Via Broadcasting | Via channels | **No** | **Yes (built-in)** |
| Multi-tenancy | Via gem | Via package | Via package | **External** | **Built-in** |

Where Wheels still trails 4.0 vs peers: ecosystem size, community size, bidirectional WebSocket (intentional non-goal — Wheels uses SSE as the cross-engine-uniform real-time primitive), asset-pipeline maturity (Vite integration is newer than Rails' / Laravel's Vite tooling).

## How to read this doc

- **New** — capability did not exist in 3.0; added in 4.0.
- **Formalized** — capability had partial or undocumented precedent; became production-ready with tests + docs in 4.0.
- **Hardened** — capability existed; security-tightened in 4.0.
- **Fixed** — bug that made the 3.0 capability unreliable; resolved in 4.0.
- **Breaking** — default behavior changed in a way that requires user action when upgrading (see the Upgrade Guide, forthcoming).
- **Deprecated** — 3.0 surface retained but marked for removal.
- **Removed** — 3.0 surface removed entirely.
- **Renamed / Refactored / Refreshed / Streamlined / Changed** — shape-change without functional parity loss.
