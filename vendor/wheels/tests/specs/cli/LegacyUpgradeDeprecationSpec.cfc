/**
 * Regression: cli/src/commands/wheels/upgrade.cfc is the legacy CommandBox
 * `box wheels upgrade` command. Its getAvailableVersions() hardcoded a static
 * list maxing at "3.1.0", so a user on 3.0.0 running `box wheels upgrade` was
 * told "You are already on the latest version" — silently missing every 4.x
 * release. The post-upgrade-recommendations URL pointed at the pre-4.0
 * upgrade page, and the breaking-changes map had no 3.x -> 4.x entries.
 *
 * The CommandBox `wheels-cli` module is already deprecated for v5.0 removal
 * per the 4.0 CHANGELOG. The fix is to print a deprecation
 * banner directing users to the new `wheels` CLI and short-circuit before the
 * stale ForgeBox lookup. The fix MUST also update the post-upgrade URL to
 * the canonical v4.0 guide so any user still reaching it lands somewhere
 * useful.
