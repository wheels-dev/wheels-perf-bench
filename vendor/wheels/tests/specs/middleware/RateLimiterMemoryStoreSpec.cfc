/**
 * Memory-storage maintenance hardening for RateLimiter (issue #2971):
 *
 * 1. handle() previously called $evictOldest() with no lock — concurrent
 *    requests raced the eviction bookkeeping (an eviction storm could purge
 *    far more than the intended 25% headroom). Emergency eviction now goes
 *    through $lockedEvictOldest(), double-checked under the same named
 *    maintenance lock the periodic cleanup uses.
 * 2. The eviction's second pass ran an ArraySort with a closure comparator
 *    over the entire remaining store on the unlucky request thread. It now
 *    uses bounded random sampling (Redis-style approximated oldest-first).
 * 3. The periodic cleanup scanned every key inline on the request thread.
 *    The scan is now capped per pass with a rotating cursor so successive
 *    passes cover the whole store.
 *
 * Concurrency itself can't be exercised deterministically from a spec, so
 * the lock discipline and the no-sort/bounded-scan facts are pinned at
 * source level (the established pattern for structural guarantees), while
 * the store-bound behavior is asserted behaviorally via $storeSize().
