/**
 * Regression for issue #2959 — dev-UI delivery refactor (wave 2 review
 * remediation, P2 Medium).
 *
 * `vendor/wheels/public/views/cli.cfm` ships a 1,000+ line `cfswitch`
 * over 44 commands plus an in-page UDF for test-data generation. Two
 * structural defects need addressing without expanding the wave-2
 * `cli.cfm` hardening PR:
 *
 *   1. The `dbSetup` case re-enters the dispatcher via a recursive
 *      `cfinclude` of `cli.cfm` itself (mutating `request.wheels.params`
 *      mid-flight to fake a `dbSeed` call). The recursive include rebuilds
 *      `data` from scratch, discarding the "Migrations completed." string
 *      so the final JSON envelope reports the seed message only — the
 *      migration outcome is lost.
 *
 *   2. The error envelope is inconsistent: per-command catches set
 *      `data.message` (singular) while the outer catch sets
 *      `data.messages` (plural). A CLI client that reads either name in
 *      isolation will miss half the failure modes.
 *
 * Cross-framework research (Rails, Laravel, Django, Phoenix, Spring,
 * Symfony) converged on: sub-action chaining happens through direct
 * method calls (`$this->call(...)` / `call_command(...)` /
 * `Rake::Task[...].invoke`) — never by re-entering the dispatcher view.
 * The Wheels equivalent for the minimum-viable refactor is to extract
 * the seed orchestration into a helper that `dbSetup` calls directly,
 * preserving the migration message in the response envelope.
 *
 * This spec source-scans `cli.cfm` (mirroring the existing cli/* spec
 * style — `OnErrorFallbackGuardSpec.cfc`, `PackagesCommandHelpSpec.cfc`)
 * because cli.cfm runs under a full HTTP request context that the spec
 * runner does not synthesize.
 *
 * NOTE: tag names in this file are deliberately written WITHOUT angle
 * brackets, and the cfinclude regex below is built via Chr(60)
 * concatenation. Lucee's pre-compile tag scanner parses literal tag text
 * even inside comments and strings; a bracketed cfswitch/cfinclude here
 * crashes the entire core bundle with "attribute [expression] is required
 * for tag [cfswitch]" (CLAUDE.md "Lucee Tag Scanner" gotcha).
